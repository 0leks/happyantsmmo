players are ants, run around collecting pollen (replace coins with pollen)

player can hold a limited number of pollen
with enough pollen, can place a cache where can store pollen and add it to account

(keep track of pollen held by player separately from pollen stored in cache)

can make more caches but costs much more pollen

each player can only see their own caches

next minigame will be all about converting pollen to honey

then maybe honey to wax???

players can level up their 
- holding capacity
- pollen colleciton efficiency
- pollen to honey conversion


oops its not bees, perhaps some other material instead of pollen
